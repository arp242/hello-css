Hello, CSS!
===========

Hello, CSS! is a CSS template which styles most elements to neutral and
aesthetically pleasing defaults. I copy/pasted variants of this so often I
figured I might as well put a cleaned up and annotated version somewhere.

I encourage you to pick ’n choose what you need, rather than insert everything.

Design principles
-----------------

> Good typography can help your reader devote less attention to the mechanics of
> reading and more attention to your message. Conversely, bad typography can
> distract your reader and undermine your message.
>
> —Matthew Butterick, [*Practical Typography*](https://practicaltypography.com/)

1. Pleasant defaults that should work well for most websites.
2. Main focus is text and good typography.
3. Simplicity matters: easy to extend or modify.
4. Works on all browser, screen sizes, assistive technology, and when printed.

### Example pages.

<!-- <aside>Email me if you’re using it and I’ll add your site.</aside> -->

- [demo/README.html](https://arp242.github.io/hello-css/demo/README.html) (just base.css);
  [demo/README-fancy.html](https://arp242.github.io/hello-css/demo/README-fancy.html) (all files).
- My website, [arp242.net](https://arp242.net).
- [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) for both the public facing website
  as well as the backend (with quite a few additions, but Hello, CSS! as the
  base template).
- I reformatted [The Art of Unix programming](https://arp242.net/the-art-of-unix-programming) with this template.
- [My CV](https://arp242.net/cv/CV-MartinTournoij.pdf).

Usage
-----

There are several files, mix-and-match as you want.

There are only a few classes (see the table below); for the most part element
selectors are used (e.g. `blockquote { .. }` instead of `.blockquote { .. }`).

The files are brief and well annotated, and a number of styles have
commented-out alternatives. I encourage you to read and modify to your
preference, rather than blindly copy/paste.<!--<sup><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup> -->

Not every last element is styled. For some things – such as &lt;abbr&gt; – it’s
fine to rely on the browser defaults, small differences are okay. Feel free to
open an issue if you’re missing something in particular.

### HTML example

A typical HTML page might look something like:

    <body>
        <nav class="center">
            <a href="/">Home</a>
            <a href="/weblog">Weblog</a>
        </nav>

        <article class="page">
            <h1>Main content</h1>
            <p>..</p>

            <div class="postscript"><strong>Footnotes</strong>
                ..
            </div>
            <div class="postscript"><strong>Feedback</strong>
                ..
            </div>
        </article>

        <footer class="center" style="text-align: right">

### Classes

| Class        | File           | Purpose                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .center      | base.css       | Center-align the main content.                                                         |
| .page        | base.css       | Main page body.                                                                        |
| .page-a4     | base.css       | A4 page size; useful when producing pages where printing is high priority (e.g. a CV). |
| .page-letter | base.css       | U.S. letter page size.                                                                 |

| .border      | base.css       | Add a border around figure elements.                                                   |
| .link        | base.css       | Format as a link; mainly for buttons, since regular links can't do POST requests.      |
| .left        | base.css       | Left-align a table cell.                                                               |
| .right       | base.css       | Right-align a table cell; the cell will also use tabular numbers for alignment.        |

| .vertical    | form.css       | Layout the form vertically (labels above inputs).                                      |
| .horizontal  | form.css       | Layout the form horizontally (labels next to inputs).                                  |

### Included files

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| base.css       | Basic defaults; this is the bulk of the project. |
| form.css       | Forms, inputs, labels (WIP).                     |

The `dist/` directory contains versions without extensive annotations, as well
as an `all.css` which contains all of the above files.

You can use the [singlepage](https://github.com/arp242/singlepage) tool to
inline CSS files in to a document with `<style>` tags.
